Purpose of the app

The purpose of the app is to self-teach Shiny by reading the following material:
* https://engineering-shiny.org/
* https://mastering-shiny.org/

The app will have the following features:
* A front-end framework (shiny.fluent?)
* A login page (Firebase integration?)
* Fitted brms models served as biology simulations: Lotka-Volterra (https://magesblog.com/post/2021-02-08-fitting-multivariate-ode-models-with-brms/), https://sites.google.com/site/biologydarkow/home 
* Dynamic pop ups - if good experimental values are inputted in experiment no. 1 (assuming the simulations are like labs), prompt the user to answer questions or think through experiment no. 2 
* End of chapter questions and section on reading materials 
* brms models let simulate result with any condition and any experimental sequence, virtual lab bench
